## Infrastructure as Code

- [AzAPI version 2.0 released (GA)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-tools-blog/announcing-azapi-2-0/ba-p/4275733) : The [AzAPI provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs) is designed to expedite the integration of new Azure services with HashiCorp Terraform. It functions as a lightweight layer atop the Azure ARM REST APIs, and is a first class provider experience along with the [AzureRM provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs). Azure resources that might not yet be or may never be supported in AzureRM can be accessed by this provider, including private/public preview services and features. v2.0 now fully supports HCL (no more JSON) among other updates. Both [Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-tools-blog/unlocking-the-best-of-azure-with-azurerm-and-azapi-providers/ba-p/4283264) and [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/enhancing-azure-deployments-with-azurerm-and-azapi-terraform-providers) have blog posts comparing AzureRM and AzAPI and scenarios where you might choose one over the other (they're mostly the same post but with some additional stuff in each :-) There is also now a tool ([aztfmigrate](https://github.com/Azure/aztfmigrate)) that lets you migrate resources between the two providers.
