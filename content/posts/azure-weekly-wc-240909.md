Summary of Azure snippets for the week commencing 9th September 2024, grouped by Azure service. Back to regular posting following holidays - though only a couple of updates this time around.

No monthly summary for August as there was only [one other post](/posts/azure-weekly-wc-240812) before this one that wasn't covered by [July's summary](/posts/azure-monthly-2407/).

GA = Generally Available
